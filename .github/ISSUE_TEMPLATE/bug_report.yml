            This is an issue specific to Azure DevOps or this repository and does not belong in [dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core).
            Specific issues for dependabot are solved faster in the core repository. For example, why a package version is skipped.
            Trying out this behaviour in the GitHub Hosted version can help you pinpoint where it lies.

            I have linked a public reproduction of the specific issue or none is required because the issue is not specific to me.
            Please note that you can create a public organization/project and repository to show the issue. This tends to accelerate resolution.
